        <h2>About Password Manager</h2>
        <p>This project was made by a few students of "Team Heisenberg" as part of a school competition, called "HackTUES 9". The competition lasted around 3 days and was centered around the security of the user. We decided to make a website which protects people's password by telling them how strong their passwords are. In case it's not strong, they will be able to generate a new one. </p>
